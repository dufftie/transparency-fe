# About
 
Läbipaistvus is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to promoting transparency within Estonian media. Our mission is to ensure that media outlets uphold the highest standards of objectivity and fairness when reporting the news. We carefully analyze articles from prominent Estonian publications, such as Postimees, Delfi, and others, to assess the degree of neutrality in their coverage. By evaluating how various media sources present information, we seek to identify any potential biases that may influence public perception, particularly when certain political agendas or parties are involved.

Our goal is to foster a media landscape in Estonia where transparency and impartiality are central to every report. We firmly believe that all media outlets should present events in a balanced manner, free from the influence of political bias or agendas. In an era where information is constantly shaping public opinion, it is crucial for news organizations to be accountable for the way they portray stories. At Läbipaistvus, we are committed to helping both the public and the media make informed decisions by highlighting when and where objectivity is compromised.

Through our work, we aim to create a more informed and engaged society, where individuals can trust that the news they receive is based on facts and unbiased reporting. As a non-profit entity, Läbipaistvus operates independently from any political or corporate interests, ensuring that our evaluations remain impartial and dedicated solely to the principles of transparency and journalistic integrity.
